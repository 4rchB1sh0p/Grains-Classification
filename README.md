# Grains Classification

Classification of grains in an image using k-means clustering. Matlab is used for image processing.


## Repository Contents

# Part-1
In this application, grains of rice lying on a wooden table are to be counted. Other objects, such as
chickpeas that are also present in the image, should not be counted.
An algorithm developed using k-means clustering automatically counts the rice grains.

# Part-2
In this part the image is with chickpeas as well as rice grains. The number of the rice grains is
to be determined.

To classify the rice grains, a few suitable region properties are to be used as features.
The following steps of image processing before segmentation and classification are useful:
- remove the non-uniform illumination
- remove the structure of the wooden table
